# dapp-essential-functions-duplicate-check

Datesets and scripts for checking duplicated essential functions 

## Usage

Put contract files you want to compare in `smart_contracts` directory (you can first remove the existing files in `smart_contracts` directory), then run `main.py`

The results will be stored in `essential_dup.log`.

The essential functions are stored in `functions` directory, do not remove them, do not modify `functions_sol.log`.
